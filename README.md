# Rig-controller
Control a rig for manual testing of sensors

The controller is made up of four degrees of freedom. An x, y, z and tilt axis. We can use this platform to gather a series of directions, pressures, textures and angles to gather a robust dataset. This repository will provide the control for this rig so others can replicate the rig and generate their own data sets.
